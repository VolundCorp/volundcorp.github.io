                    <p>By using <code>/setup</code>, you'll create Volund's forge.</p>
                    <p>The forge is the foundation of Volund. Thanks to the it, you will be able to perform several actions linked to the bot:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b class="enum">Create a category:</b> These custom sections can contain as many text channels as you want, a news channel and a voice lobby. It is up to you to choose
                            among these different channels to put in your category. When you click on the ‚öíÔ∏è button, you'll be asked to fill in a form with :
                            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
                                <li>Category's name</li>

                        <li><b class="enum">Create a voice lobby:</b> This type of voice channel is a bit special. Once you connect to it, it will create a temporary voice channel and
                        move you to it.</li>
                        <li><b class="enum">Upgrade your own tool:</b> In order to mine with more efficiency in Volund's mine, you can upgrade your own tool. For more information, see <a href="#mine">here</a>.</li>
                        <li><b class="enum">Increase categories limit:</b> You can't create infinite categories but you can increase this limit just by paying some ingots gathered in the mine.</li>
                        <li><b class="enum">Set welcome message:</b> Volund is capable of welcoming your newcomers with custom message.<br><i>You'll have to unlock it with <code>/unlock</code> first.</i></li>

                    <h2>Mine</h2>
                    <p>By using <code>/setup-mine</code>, you'll create Volund's mine. This mine is actually a mini-game where you can dig and try to harvest ores with the ‚õèÔ∏è button.
                    To do so, you have a personal tool that you can upgrade with the forge. Each time you harvest an ore, you'll earn <b class="enum">1 ingot per level</b> of your tool.</p>
                    <p>Before finding any ore, you'll have to dig in the mine. Each time you try to dig, you have a chance to find <b class="enum">5 ores</b>. This chance is <b class="enum">50%</b> when Volund has just been installed
                        but can be increased by <b class="enum">5%</b> with the forge. Once you tried to dig, if you don't find ore, then you'll have to wait <b class="enum">60 seconds</b> before being able to dig again.
                    If you succeed and find ore, then you'll be able to harvest it every <b class="enum">30 seconds</b> until the vein runs out.</p>
                    <p>The ingots (or gold) you earn by mining are stored in your personal wallet. You can use it to upgrade your own tool in the <a href="#forge">forge</a>
                    or invest it in the server using the <a href="#invest"><code>/invest</code> command</a>.</p>
                    <p><i>Just in case the mine seems broken, you can click the refresh</i> üîÑÔ∏è <i>button.</i></p>

                    <p>Thanks to the <code>/unlock</code> command, you'll be able to unlock locked features.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you want to set a customized welcome message, you will first have to unlock this feature. Unlocking a feature has a cost and
                        this cost will be applied on the server's wallet. If you want to pay for it, you can just check the amount needed and then use the <a href="#invest"><code>/invest</code>

                    <p>Some features of Volund have a cost, whether for <a href="#unlock">unlocking</a> or for <a href="#forge">use</a>. In order to allow the server to grow thanks to Volund, you will have to invest your
                        ingots you got by mining in the server's wallet. Simply use <code>/invest</code> command and a form will ask you how much you want to invest.
