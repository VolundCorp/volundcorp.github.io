                    <p>Once the forge has been set, it is possible for you to create <b class="enum">voice lobbies</b>.
                        These channels are meant to create as many voice channels as you want
                        by simply joining them.</p>
                    <h3>How to create a voice channel</h3>

                    <p>In order to ‚ú®beautify‚ú® your temporary voice channels, it is possible to use templates. These

                        In this way, it is possible for you to have a lobby dedicated to a role linked to the previously
                        created category. By default, their template is "<code>{N¬∞} {LOBBY}</code>".</p>
